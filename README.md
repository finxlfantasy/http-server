HTTP Server in Rust
This repository contains a simple HTTP server implemented in Rust. The server can handle incoming requests, parse them, and generate appropriate responses. Below are the key components and functionalities of the server.

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites: Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download it from here.

### Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-server-rust.git
cd http-server-rust
```

### Build and Run:
```
cargo build
cargo run
```

The server will start listening on port 8080 by default.

# Components
## 1. Request Parsing
The server parses incoming HTTP requests into three main components:

Start Line: Extracts the request method, request path, and HTTP version.
Headers: Parses headers into a HashMap for easy access.
Body: Retrieves the body content (if any).
## 2. handle_connection Function
The heart of the server lies in the handle_connection function:

### Rust
```
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

This function is called for each incoming connection. It reads the request, processes it, and generates an appropriate response.

## 3. Response Generation
The server currently provides a basic response for requests:

For the root path (“/”), it returns an “HTTP 200 OK” response.
For paths starting with “/echo/”, it echoes back the requested path.
# Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
Send requests to http://localhost:8080/your-path.
Feel free to customize this server for your specific use case!

# Customizing Responses
You can easily customize the server’s behavior by modifying the handle_connection function. Here are some ideas:

## 1. Dynamic Content
Instead of fixed responses, generate dynamic content based on the request. For example:

Return the current date and time.
Fetch data from a database or an external API.
Serve files from a specific directory.
## 2. Error Handling
Improve error handling by adding appropriate status codes and error messages. For instance:

Handle invalid request paths with a “404 Not Found” response.
Check for malformed requests and respond with a “400 Bad Request” status.
## 3. Security Measures
Consider security aspects:

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Validate input data to prevent injection attacks.
Set up HTTPS for secure communication.
